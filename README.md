## How To run the code
Download and go to our folder using Terminal and run the command :
```
cmake . 
```
```
make
```
Then it will generate five executable file (starter1,main1_simu,main1_rest,main3_simu,main3_rest)
Use the following command to run it.
```
./name_of_executable_file
```

For the starter2, we have a problem to translate .py to .cpp file, so we just keeped the .py file. And we also have a matlab file named Minutiae_extraction.m

When running the code,the result will automatically save in the directory named [result](result).

Some of our programs takes long time to run (main1 restauration which depends on size of dictionary and main3 resutauration takes 6 minutes). So we did not test all the values in our program. We saved all the results generated by different values in the directory [all_result](all_result).
